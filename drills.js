// Use recursion to solve these problems.

// What is recursion? A method of problem solving that involves a function calling itself wherein each call breaks down the problem into smaller parts until it is simplified. Recursion is like a process where you define a problem in terms of a simpler version of itself. 

// recursion is NOT a data structure or an algorithm. It is a concept.

// A recursive algorithm is broken down into 2 parts: A base case (stop condition) & recursive case (function calling itself). 

// 1. Base case: solution to the "simplest" possible problem.

// 2. Recursive case is when you use the same algorithm to solve a simpler problem of itself with the same number of parameters to solve a smaller version of the problem.
